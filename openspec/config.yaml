# Project context (optional)
# This is shown to AI when creating artifacts.
# Add your tech stack, conventions, style guides, domain knowledge, etc.
# Example:
context: |
  Tech stack: C++, Arduino
  We use conventional commits
  Domain: Air Quality Sensor

# Per-artifact rules (optional)
# Add custom rules for specific artifacts.
rules:
  tasks:
    - Always include a final verification task: "Run `arduino-cli compile --fqbn arduino:avr:uno SEN55-ILI9486-Air-Quality-Sensor.ino` to ensure embedded compatibility"
    - Always include a final verification task: "Clear all CMake build artifacts (`rm -rf build`), rebuild from scratch, and run all tests (`ctest`) to ensure clean state correctness"
